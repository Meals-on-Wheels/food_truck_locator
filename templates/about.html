        <p>I technically started coding when I was 8 with very low level Visual Basic in notepad, and transitioned to JavaScript when I was 15 still at a very low level as a hobby on the side. I served in the Army from 2015 to 2020 and over my last year in service I picked up Python as a language and started to really put effort into taking my skill set to the next level, and went through Code Fellows 201, 301, and now 401 courses to hone that skill.
